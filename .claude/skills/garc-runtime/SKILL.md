# GARC Runtime Skill

## When to use this skill

Use GARC when the user asks you to:
- Send emails, search Gmail, read emails
- Create or update Google Calendar events, check availability
- Read/write Google Drive files, upload/download, create docs
- Read/write Google Sheets data
- Manage Google Tasks
- Check OAuth scope requirements for a GWS task
- Manage the agent memory/context
- Register or manage agents

## Pre-flight checklist

Before any GARC operation:

1. **Check config**
   ```bash
   garc status
   ```
   All items must be ✅. If not, guide through `garc setup all`.

2. **Infer scopes** (for new task types)
   ```bash
   garc auth suggest "<task description>"
   ```
   Note the gate level. Act accordingly.

3. **Check execution gate**
   - `none` → proceed immediately
   - `preview` → show user what will happen, confirm before executing
   - `approval` → create approval request, wait for human approval
